# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- The Project I was working on was the final project. This was by far the most complex project I worked with since there were a lot of things I had to implement and debug. 
# What did you do particularly well?
- What I think I did particularly well is the fac that I was able to code and compile my program to where it was able to run. 
# Where could you improve?
- I feel like I could improve in the debugging stage of my project. There are multiple stages of the debugging stage and with each stage I had to make sure i was doing the process correctly otherwise I would have to go back and fix it.
# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
- Tools and networks I'm adding to my support network are my peers and websites such as YouTube. With this, I'm able to gain the help I need whenever I'm stuck on a problem
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
- Skills from this project that will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work is the fact that I can code and debeug which is very important in the computer science industry. Coding has been continously improving and changing so having knowledge in this area is important.
# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by keeping it simple and getting the job done without overcomplicating things. If I were to implement unnecessary things, it would have made things messy and unorganized for me.
